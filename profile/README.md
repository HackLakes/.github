# ‚úàÔ∏èYYZHacks
## Brainstormingüß†
### Introduction
- 12 hour hackathon (Sam mentioned this) 
- 30-50 people hackathon
- Hackathon theme or idea hasn't been decided on yet
- Somewhhere in Downtown Toronto or Missisauga
- Goal is to be like Hack Club Assemble (meaning a good vibe)
- Toronto hasn't had a inperson hackathon  in a while (hack the north will be the first one)
### Why 12 hours?
- The Budget is less (which means we don't have to raise much)
- We have to provide food, prizes, and something fun
- Since we're going to expect 30-50, there's probaly going to be less people maybe 20
- We don't need that much of a budget for the event
- Easier to run by one person
### Why Make a hackathon?
I recently attended my first hackathon this summer, Hack Club Assemble. It was a 42 hour event in the heart of Downtown San Francisco and it changed my life. Those 42 hours introduced me to possibiltes. It taught me new concepts in programming, and led me to building a project with code that for the first time I'm actually proud of, and have a sense of my own. I got to work with someone, and try to understand why my project didn't work. While I may not have understood what's wrong, I learned for the future how to approch new problems, and build projects. It showed me what you can do with programming. Assemble also set the stage in making me confident that programming is my future, and something I will hopefully spend the rest of my life in. All of thesse are reasons why I want to host a hackathon in Toronto. Toronto isn't new to programming. Most people make hackathons to introduce computer science, or improve equailty, which are all vaild reasons to start one. Toronto and the GTA have had their fair share of hackathons in the past. HackTheNorth, Hackthe6ix, Tohacks, Frasherhacks, the list goes on, and on. HacktheNorth for example is running Toronto's First offline hackathon since 2019. In the time since hackathons have shifted online, and everything speical about them have disappred. Online hackathons do not have the real feeling of a offline hackathon. The chance to explore, and freely discover isn't the same through zoom. Majorty of Ontairo students have also spent their fair share in their homes, from online school to online classes. It's time for a change. While YYZhacks may not be the first inperson hackathon since Covid, It will be the second. 
TLDR: Hackathons allow people to explore, and discover new things. Hackathons allow people to feel more condifent, and introduced to programming. We've spent our fair share of time online, and Toronto has not had a high school hackathon since 2019. HackTheNorth which is a prommient hackathon in the Toronto Area will be hosting the first later this year. The differnce between HackTheNorth and HackYYZ are board. The themes are differnt, the budget is smaller, there is no 20+ team, it is not overnight. HackYYZ is a small scale event locally to have people exprince something new, and if they already know programming it's a place to allow them to be more confidet and learn new things. Hackathons have already changed my life, and I'm ready to transform the lives of others, with one event.
